# Cadencia - Filecoin Insights

<br>

Cadencia.crypto is a dashboard that provides insights into the storage capabilities of the Filecoin network. Instead of focusing on performance metrics related to the blockchain, Cadencia sheds light on the network's storage capacity (verified data, non-verified data, committed capacity), miner metrics, and storage power by region. A user can also utilize Cadencia's map view to access miner geo data and also see successful deals visualized as flows across the map.

We wanted these metrics to be more accessible so Filecoin users and miners could get a picture of the current state of global storage.

At the moment we are using mock data. The purpose is to establish which stats would be most meaningful to a variety of users. We hope that as the Filecoin ecosystem matures we will have better access to real data and seamlessly stream it on Cadencia.

Ideas we would like to implement in the future:

- retrieval metrics
- a GUI for miners to monitor contracts, locked FIL, personal storage power, and deal-making settings
- ability to look up file/replication histories via the content address 
- verification service for clients
